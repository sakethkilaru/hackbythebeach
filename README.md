# hackbythebeach
We planned to join the hackathon to gain experience on how to code.
However none of us have any prior experience in coding and hence we found it hard to keep up with the hackathon.
We are extremely sorry for our lack of participation and we will ensure to be prepared next time.
Regards,
Shatas
